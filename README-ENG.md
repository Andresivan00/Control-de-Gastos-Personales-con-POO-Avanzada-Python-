# Personal Expense Management with Advanced OOP (Python)

A **complete personal finance system** built with modern **Object-Oriented Programming**, clean and 100% functional. Perfect for learning real OOP, file handling, and best practices.

### What this code does

* `Movimiento` class: represents an income or expense with strict validations
* `ControlGastos` class: the brain of the system with all functionalities:

  * Register incomes and expenses
  * Calculate current balance (income − expenses)
  * View expense summary by category
  * Save and load data in **JSON** and **CSV** (real persistence!)
  * Use typing with `typing`, clean methods, and error handling
